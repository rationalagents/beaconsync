What's this for?
---

beaconsync is a pattern, and WordPress plugin, associating WordPress content and Bluetooth proximity beacons, e.g. Apple's iBeacons. This enables a growing class of app that use beacons for accurate positioning, while keeping content management for such apps simple, familiar, and webby. The pattern & plugin can be applied in apps that use any beacon spec, incuding AltBeacon.

Install the plugin
---
Download https://github.com/rationalagents/beaconsync/archive/master.zip then upload the file in the Plugins section of your WordPress site's administration screens.

Don't forget to activate the plugin after you've uploaded it!

Associate posts with beacons
---

To associate a beacon with a post, edit the post. You'll see **Beacon UUID** and **Beacon Major/Minor** sections (they're very similar to the built-in *Category* section.) Add the beacon's UUID, for example *2b41bbe2-42c2-4b84-ab96-6e9d5509138b*, and major/minor values, for example *0.2* for major value 0, minor value 2, in these sections:

![Screenshot of afformentioned sections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rationalagents/beaconsync/master/docs/beacon-ui.png "The Beacon UUID and Beacon Major/Minor sections")

Be sure to click "Update" to save your changes.

Avoid adding more than 1 UUID or major/minor per post, as this may result in undefined behavior in apps. Adding UUID but not major/minor, or major/minor and not UUID is fine though: for example, if each of your beacons has a different UUID you may choose to add only UUID. Apps must support this usage.

How apps should use a beaconsync site
---
A special-purpose app that can detect beacons (for example, a city walking tour app) should retreive a content index to go with those beacons from a corresponding WordPress beaconsync site. It can retrieve the data using the site's Atom or RSS2 feed.

The following examples are for Atom (http://www.rfc-base.org/rfc-4287.html), but RSS2 is similar.

A post associated with a beacon has &lt;beacon:uuid&gt; and/or &lt;beacon:majorminor&gt; elements within the corresponding &lt;entry&gt;, for example:

	<entry>
		<title>Bar Gernika</title>
		<link href="http://www.boisebeaconblog.com/posts/bar-gernika" />
		<id>http://www.boisebeaconblog.com/postid/1</id>
		<published>2003-12-13T18:30:02Z</published>
		<updated>2014-03-26T06:59:04Z</updated>
		<summary>Bar Gernika has been a fixture on the Basque Block for almost 20 years 
		         and serves authentic Basque foods, wine and desserts.
		         Try the croquetas!</summary>
		<!-- ... -->
		<beacon:uuid>2b41bbe2-42c2-4b84-ab96-6e9d5509138b</beacon:uuid>
		<beacon:majorminor>0.2</beacon:majorminor>
		<!-- ... -->
	</entry>
  
After detecting the beacon *b41bbe2-42c2-4b84-ab96-6e9d5509138b.0.2* the app may choose to follow the corresponding &lt;entry&gt;'s &lt;link&gt; within a web browser frame, or may choose to display other Atom element values like &lt;title&gt; and &lt;summary&gt;, or Atom extension element values.

The app controls how much of the feed data it caches, and should sync as often as necessary to support the frequency of addition/repurposing of beacons and updating of content. It should at minimum cache the beacon:uuid, beacon:majorminor, and link, for quick response to detection of a beacon that matches that UUID and major/minor.

History

This concept and implementation came about as part of a volunteer effort for Discovery Center of Idaho
(http://www.dcidaho.org) to improve exhibit signage and depth of available information. Please feel free to use it and give me feedback!
